        <title> title not heading</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>what is the actual difference in between heading and title? so a tilte is something that goes in the browser but the heading as h1/h2/h3 is a block element^ that is part of the body of the page, <br> 
        blok element is always somenting whole that ocupies a full block on page, as for a inline element would be seen a literally in line, like a line / link it self ex:"visit brazilian google" </p>
<h1>
     first project w this htlm thing (and this is supposed to be a big heading) yeaahh 
</h1>
    <p> I hope this is set in a paragraph like is supposed to... but yeah it worked as a paragraph
        do i need to make a p opening and closing tag for every entry or can i make just a big entrace (open n close in the end
    </p>
<h2> now this is the second heading, is this maybe smaller???? i hope so honestly</h2>
    <p> okay so there are this things which are parent elements, these are elements which allow other block or inline elemnts to be attached to them <br>
    like lists, links, pictures, etc, (i have to check for more examples) </p>
    <h3> so if the htlm works like assembling a body whith all its parts and contents being ordered and having parent child relationships to each other, can i make doubles of headings and etc?
        and do i have a "feet" to detrmine the very end of the page? </h3>
        <P> eu quero crescer e ser mt boa c isso </P>

        <li>my weed</li>

        </ul>

        <p> honestly im really enjoying learning how to communicate all this on teh informatic language;
            it is pretty cool to find the patterns and memorize the tags ; it comes with practice most of it; <br>
            i just need to undersatnd better what are the elements and how they relate with each other directly how caan i precisely  
             something and display it as i want it to be <br>
             just making sure i can at least review, check for buggs and understand better the formation when it comes to css;
             html im not a pro but i understood the overall logic, how it workks, and honestly ive been compiling a better explanation by my self than compared to my teacher's lessons'
            
        </p>

<a> so this reffers to a hyper link , im never supposed to do an entry like a / <br>
    if i'm not adding any inline elements
</a>
<br> <a href= google.com.br > visit brazilian google </a>
<p> can i do a link connection w/o using the a ?</p>
