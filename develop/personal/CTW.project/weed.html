    <h1> What is weed?</h1>
</header>
<main>
    <p> Weed is the general term for any plant growing where it is not wanted. Ever since humans first attempted the cultivation of plants, they have had to fight the invasion by weeds into areas chosen for crops.</p>
    <p> Now Cannabis, also called weed, Marijuana, herb, pot, grass, bud, ganja, Mary Jane, and a vast number of other slang terms—is a greenish-gray mixture of the dried flowers of Cannabis sativa.</p>
    <p> Some people smoke marijuana in hand-rolled cigarettes called joints; in pipes, water pipes (sometimes called bongs), or in blunts (marijuana rolled in cigar wraps).</p>
    <p> Marijuana can also be used to brew tea and, particularly when it is sold or consumed for medicinal purposes, is frequently mixed into foods (edibles) such as brownies, cookies, or candies. Vaporizers are also increasingly used to consume marijuana. Stronger forms of marijuana include sinsemilla (from specially tended female plants) and concentrated resins containing high doses of marijuana’s active ingredients, including honeylike hash oil, waxy budder, and hard amberlike shatter. These resins are increasingly popular among those who use them both recreationally and medically.</p>
    <aside> We actually believe that if everyone smoked weed we would be able to have a broader perspective and a brigter outview on life</aside>
    <p> The main psychoactive(mind-altering) chemical in marijuana, responsible for most of the intoxicating effects that people seek, is delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). The chemical is found in resin produced by the leaves and buds primarily of the female cannabis plant. The plant also contains more than 500 other chemicals, including more than 100 compounds that are chemically related to THC, called cannabinoids.</p>
    <aside> Even though tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the compound that causes the high that cannabis is famous for, it only counts for up to 25% - 30% of thhe weed flower, other important cannabinoids also have effects on your body, such as CBD</aside>
    <p> A safe, non-addictive substance, CBD is one of more than a hundred “phytocannabinoids,” which are unique to cannabis and endow the plant with its robust therapeutic profile.</p>
    <p> Today the therapeutic properties of CBD are being tested and confirmed by scientists and doctors around the world.</p>
    <p> Both CBD and THC have significant therapeutic attributes. But unlike THC, CBD does not make a person feel “stoned” or intoxicated. That’s because CBD and THC act in different ways on different receptors in the brain and body.</p>
    <p> CBD can actually lessen or neutralize the psychoactive effects of THC, depending on how much of each compound is consumed. Many people want the health benefits of cannabis without the high – or with less of a high. The fact that CBD is therapeutically potent as well as non-intoxicating, and easy to take as a CBD oil, makes it an appealing treatment option for those who are cautious about trying cannabis for the first time.</p>
    <p> Weed in the enviroment as a plant, has a very positive impact on whichever place it grows; Cannabis does not imply competition on it's enviroment which means tere is a higer probability of sucessfully in coexistencing with other plants and animals; </p>
    <p> Recently after 20-year research on phytoremediation in Chernobyl; it has been stated that Cannabis has higher leves of phytoremediation than most plants participating in the study, which amounts to: not only growing weed, helping the envrioment, remediating the soil, producing eco friendly universal resources and slowly shifting from a non/sustainable
